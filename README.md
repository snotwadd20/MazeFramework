# MazeFramework 

This is a framework for Unity (5.3+) that makes mazes. It also displays them in a limited fashion (debug draw to scene view and debug print to console). Turn Gizmos on to see what it displays.

I keep having to rewrite this code, so I'm just putting it up here so I don't have to do it anymore.
